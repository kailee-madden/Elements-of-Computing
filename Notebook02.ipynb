    "\n",
    "1) Did you use a **data structure** in your program? If so, which one and why? Could you have used another one instead (which one)?\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a tuple because I knew that I would not be changing the values in the data structure. However, I could have just as easily used a list and then I would have the option to append it and add in or take away values that I want the Magic 8-Ball to print as answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Is your Magic 8-Ball positive, negative, or neutral? If you wanted to make an overly pessimistic or negative Magic 8-Ball, what could you do to accomplish that without removing any positive or neutral answers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I used a tuple, I cannot append to add more negative answers, but I could always go back in and make it a list or simply just type in the negative answers into the original program. Another alternative that doesn't involve adding any more answers is to use random.randint. Then since the negative answers are toward the end of the tuple, I can simply exclude some of the beginning answers by saying a range toward the end of the group of answers such as random.randint(7, 19) instead of using random.choice. And then I will use that random integer to determine what answer from my tuple to print. So I would take the random integer, say 13, tuple[13], and whatever that cooresponds to is the answer that I would have print. This way it would be more likely for it to be a negative answer, because I could create a range that simply excludes some of the positive answers as possibilities."

I also think it could more easily be edited or reapplied to a different scenario without as much worry about whether something is going to get messed up and cause an error, because it easier see and read."

    "\n",
    "I used chained conditionals again because that is what I have been using in general and I think it makes the program easy to read and follow, but also executes it effectively and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Why do you think this question often trips up canidates interviewing for programming positions? What was the hardest part for you?\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess maybe this trips people up because what you tell us as the last instructions, Boom and FizzBuzz, should actually be first, because if Fizz and Buzz go first then FizzBuzz will never occur because the first condition will be satisfied so the program won't execute the next part of the conditional statement, the same goes for using Boom, because Boom is supposed to be printed regardless of any of the other rules. For me, this was actually easier than the other activities for this assignment, my one worry was I wasn't entirely sure how to get the entire list to print, but I just guessed that I could just say numbers and it worked out. Once I knew that was right, the rest of it seemed pretty intuitive using the **chained conditionals** and making sure that the commands were in the correct order. "
