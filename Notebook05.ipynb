    "    I used a nested loop. So I used a for loop to run through all the values in the list, and within that for loop I had a while loop that ran compared the value picked from the list from the for loop with all the other values within the list. The while loop ran until the index + 1 was no longer less than the length of the list. \n",

    "    How did you detect if there is a duplicate in the list?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To detect if there were duplicates, I used a conditional statement within my nested loop that asked if the item from the list I had picked was equal to another item in the list, and then it kept running through the loop and checking it with all the other items in the list. In order to not check it against itself, I started checking the item with the item above it and ran the loop until I had reached the end of the list. This works since the upper items don't need to be rechecked against the lower ones since the lower ones already ran their checks.\n",
