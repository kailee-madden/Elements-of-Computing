    "\n",
    "1) Describe in your own words how the guessing game works. What information are you keeping track of? How do you know when the game is over?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically what happens is the program generates a random number between 0 and 9, and then it asks the user to guess what the number is. After the user has guessed, it compared the generated number to what was guessed and then says to either guess lower or higher. After three guesses though, the program ends and tells what the number was. In order for this to work, we have to keep track of the generated number, the guessed numbers, and how many guesses. The game is over when the user either correctly guesses the number, or when the user has already used three guesses. This will generate one of the two ending messages to let the user know that the game is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Did you use continue or break? If so, come up with a solution that does not use either of them. Which solution do you prefer and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "I used break, and below I have a solution that doesn't use a loop so it doesn't need to use continue or break. I prefer the solution that uses break the most because I think it is the most readable and logical. The one that doesn't use a loop is pretty awful to read and to create. And the one that just uses a loop is also good but doesn't seem quite as clear to me personally."

    "\n",
    "1) Describe in your own words how the simulation works. What are the steps you are computing? What are you keeping track of in each iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation works by keeping track of the darts that are randomly generated with coordinates in the range [0, 1] and computes the hypotenuse with respect to the origin and the x-axis. Then the program checks if the hypotenuse is less than 1 and if it is then it adds 1 to the count of the darts in the circle. It also always adds 1 to the count of the darts in the square because the circle is inside the square so the dart is always in the square. It repeats this for each iteration until the number of darts that I want to be thrown have been. Then it uses a pi estimation formula to calculate pi. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) How does the number of darts affect the accuracy of the estimate? Provide evidence for your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more darts, the more accurate the estimate will be. For example, if only one dart is used, if it is inside the circle then the value of pi estimated will be 4 but if it is not inside, then the value of pi will be zero. Neither of those two answers are particularly accuracte, but as you get higher, it become more accurate. For example, using 300 darts, I found the value of pi to be 3.1467. "
